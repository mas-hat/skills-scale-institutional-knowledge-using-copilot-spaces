# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README provides a high-level overview of how projects are managed at OctoAcme and offers direct links to detailed process guides.

_This documentation supports Issue #2: Creating a centralized landing page for OctoAcme's project management processes._

## OctoAcme Project Management Summary

OctoAcme manages projects using an **iterative, customer-focused approach** that emphasizes delivering value in small, testable increments. Our methodology is built on clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and continuous learning. Each project follows a structured lifecycle with distinct phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution & Tracking, Release & Deployment, and Retrospectives.

**Key workflows** include maintaining a prioritized backlog, conducting regular standups and sprint planning sessions, and using project boards (such as GitHub Projects) to track work through stages from Backlog to Done. Pull requests are kept small (≤400 lines when possible), include clear acceptance criteria, and require automated tests and code reviews before merging. Risk management is integrated throughout, with a dedicated Risk Register that teams review weekly to identify, assess, and mitigate potential blockers and dependencies.

**Defined roles and personas** provide clear accountability: Project Managers coordinate delivery schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success metrics; Developers implement features and collaborate on design; and QA/Testing validates quality against acceptance criteria. Each role has specific responsibilities and communication patterns designed to maintain alignment and transparency across the team and stakeholders.

**Communication and quality assurance** are foundational to our process. Teams conduct daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates to maintain visibility and address issues promptly. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance. After each project or significant milestone, retrospectives capture learnings and generate action items, fostering a culture of continuous improvement that adapts our processes based on real experience.

## Getting Started

New team members should:

1. Start with the **Project Management Overview** to understand our core principles and lifecycle
2. Review **Roles and Personas** to understand your responsibilities and how you interact with the team
3. Familiarize yourself with the relevant phase documents (Initiation, Planning, Execution, etc.) based on where your current project stands
4. Keep these guides as your source-of-truth for executing, documenting, and improving projects at OctoAcme

## Continuous Improvement

These process documents are living resources. If you identify gaps, improvements, or have questions, please contribute by opening an issue or submitting a pull request. Our processes evolve based on team feedback and lessons learned from actual project delivery.
